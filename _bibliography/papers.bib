	abstract = {Technologies related to artificial intelligence ({AI}) have a strong impact on the changes of research and creative practices in visual arts. The growing number of research initiatives and creative applications that emerge in the intersection of {AI} and art, motivates us to examine and discuss the creative and explorative potentials of {AI} technologies in the context of art. This paper provides an integrated review of two facets of {AI} and art: 1) {AI} is used for art analysis and employed on digitized artwork collections; 2) {AI} is used for creative purposes and generating novel artworks. In the context of {AI}-related research for art understanding, we present a comprehensive overview of artwork datasets and recent works that address a variety of tasks such as classification, object detection, similarity retrieval, multimodal representations, computational aesthetics, etc. In relation to the role of {AI} in creating art, we address various practical and theoretical aspects of {AI} Art and consolidate related works that deal with those topics in detail. Finally, we provide a concise outlook on the future progression and potential impact of {AI} technologies on our understanding and creation of art.},
